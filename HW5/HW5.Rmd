## Pre-Work

#### Load packages

Load the necessary package (assuming you have installed them)
```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(gapminder)
library(gridExtra)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(gdata)
```


## Problem 1: Factor management

#### Task 1.1  Drop `Oceania`

Filter out the continent `Oceania` first in preparation for the following work.

```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent)
gapmdr_filter <- 
  gapminder %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania")
levels(gapmdr_filter$continent) 
```

It could be seen that the variable `continent` still has 5 levels, even though we removed the observations whose `continent` belongs to `Oceania`.

Start dropping the unuseful levels for the variable `Oceania`.

```{r}
gapmdr_filter$continent %>%
  fct_drop() %>%
  levels()

gapmdr_dropLvl <- 
  gapmdr_filter %>%
  droplevels()
levels(gapmdr_dropLvl$continent)
```
Both functions `fct_drop()` and `droplevels()` can drop unused factor levels, but `fct_drop()` is used for a factor, but `droplevels()` can operate on either a factor or a data frame.

#### Task 1.2  Recorder the levels of `continent`

```{r}
gapmdr_dropLvl$continent%>%
  levels() 
```

By default, the levels are ordered alphabetically.

Now we reorder the country levels based on the median of `gdpPercap` in a descending order. 

```{r}
fct_reorder(gapmdr_dropLvl$continent, 
            gapmdr_dropLvl$gdpPercap, .desc = TRUE) %>%
  levels() 
```

Plot before and after reorder, for simplicity and the beauty of the graph, we only reorder and plot the variable `country` in the continent of `Americas` for the year 2007
```{r, fig.width= 12, fig.height=6}
gap_am_2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007, continent == "Americas")

p1 <- ggplot(gap_am_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = country)) + geom_point(aes(color = country), alpha = 0.8) + scale_x_log10() + theme(legend.position="bottom")
p2 <- ggplot(gap_am_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap))) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country), alpha = 0.8) + scale_x_log10() + theme(legend.position="bottom")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

## Task 1.3  Extra exploration
Instead of using the default median, I can explore some more, using gapminder data, not the one with dropped levels

#### Reorder the `country` based on its average gdp increase rate across all years available. For simplicity, we only display head 20 of the data.

```{r results='asis'}
gpmdr_slope<- 
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  do(fit = lm(gdpPercap ~ year, .)) %>% 
  summarise(country = country, intercept = coef(fit)[1],  slope= coef(fit)[2])
gpmdr_slope %>%
  head(20) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10 )
  
fct_reorder(gpmdr_slope$country, 
            gpmdr_slope$slope, .desc = TRUE) %>%
  levels() %>%
  head(20)
```

#### Reorder the factor `continent` based on its number of countries.

```{r}
fct_reorder(gapminder$continent, 
            gapminder$country,fun = n_distinct, .desc = TRUE) %>%
  levels() 
```


## Problem 2  Common Part

#### Task 2.1  Explore the effects of `arrange()`
For simplicity, I am using a new dataset obtained from `gpmdr_slope` from Task 1.3 and `gapminder` for the following questions.

```{r, fig.width= 12, fig.height=6,  results='asis'}
gpm <-
  gapminder %>%
  dplyr::select("continent", "country") %>%
  unique() %>%
  inner_join(gpmdr_slope, ., by = "country")
gpm_eur <- gpm %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  droplevels()

gpm_eur%>%
  head(20) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10 )
levels(gpm_eur$country)
p3 <- ggplot(gpm_eur, aes(x = slope, y = country)) + geom_point() 

gpm_eur_arrange <-
  gpm_eur %>%
  arrange(slope)
gpm_eur_arrange %>%
  head(20)%>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10 )
p4 <- ggplot(gpm_eur_arrange, aes(x = slope, y = country)) +
  geom_point()

grid.arrange(p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

From the following code, I found arrange() does not affect the order of `country`
```{r}
which(!levels(gpm_eur$country) == levels(gpm_eur_arrange$country))
```

I will arrange the slope again, but this time group by `continent`, and see what happens.
```{r results='asis'}
gpm_arrange_continent <-
  gpm %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  arrange(slope, .by_group = TRUE) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10 )
```


#### Task 2.2  Explore the effects of reording a factor and factor reording coupled with `arrange()`

```{r, fig.width= 12, fig.height=6}
gpm_eur_factor <- gpm_eur %>%
  mutate(country_reorder = fct_reorder(country, slope)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-country) 
gpm_eur_factor %>%
  head(20)%>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10 )

gpm_eur_factor_arrange <- gpm_eur_factor %>%
  arrange(slope) 
gpm_eur_factor_arrange %>%
  head(20) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10 )
levels(gpm_eur_factor_arrange$country_reorder)

p5 <- ggplot(gpm_eur_factor, aes(x = slope, y = country_reorder)) + geom_point(aes(color = country_reorder), alpha = 0.8) + theme(legend.position="bottom")

p6 <- ggplot(gpm_eur_factor_arrange, aes(x = slope, y = fct_reorder(country_reorder, slope))) + geom_point(aes(color = country_reorder), alpha = 0.8) + theme(legend.position="bottom")
grid.arrange(p5, p6, ncol=2)
```

The above illustration shows that for our particular usage of `arrange()` function, it does not affect the figures. However, because it is really hard to tell in tables after re-order the factors, I think we'd better add arrange() after re-order the levels.

## Problem 3: File I/O

#### Task 3.1 CSV Save

For simplicity, I play with the tibble created in the previous questions. I will firstly show the csv.

```{r}
levels(gpm_eur_factor$country_reorder)
?write.csv
write.csv(gpm_eur_factor, paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "Non-alphabetically_orderedCSV.csv", sep = ""))
gpm_eur_factor_CSVcopy <- read.csv(paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "Non-alphabetically_orderedCSV.csv", sep = ""))
levels(gpm_eur_factor_CSVcopy$country_reorder)
```

It shows that saving as csv does not preserve the factor levels, instead, it automatically ordered in alphabetical order. 

#### Task 3.2 RDS Save

```{r}
saveRDS(gpm_eur_factor, paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "Non-alphabetically_orderedRDS.rds", sep = ""))
gpm_eur_factor_RDScopy <- readRDS(paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "Non-alphabetically_orderedRDS.rds", sep = ""))
levels(gpm_eur_factor_RDScopy$country_reorder)
which( !levels(gpm_eur_factor_RDScopy$country_reorder) == 
         levels(gpm_eur_factor$country_reorder))
```

It shows that saving as RDS does preserve the factor levels.

#### Task 3.3 dput Save

```{r}
dput(gpm_eur_factor, paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "NNon-alphabetically_ordereddput", sep = ""))
gpm_eur_factor_dputCopy <- dget(paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "NNon-alphabetically_ordereddput", sep = ""))
levels(gpm_eur_factor_dputCopy$country_reorder)
which( !levels(gpm_eur_factor_dputCopy$country_reorder) == 
         levels(gpm_eur_factor$country_reorder))
```

It shows that saving using dput does preserve the factor levels.

## Problem 4: Visualization design

#### Task 4.1  Plotting the trend of GDP increase per year for countries

Before
```{r, fig.width= 7, fig.height=5}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x= year, y = gdpPercap, group= country)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4, color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("GDP Per Capita trend as year increases")
```

After
```{r, fig.width= 9, fig.height=5}
color_layer <- scale_color_manual("", #title of the legend
                                  labels = c("Other Counbtries", "Kuwait"), 
                                  values = c(brewer.pal(n=2, "Dark2")))

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x= year, y = gdpPercap, group = country)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country, 
                color = country == "Kuwait",
                alpha = country == "Kuwait")) +
  color_layer +
  scale_alpha_discrete(range = c(0.3, 0.5),
                       guide = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("GDP Per Capita trend as year increases")
```

#### Task 4.2  Scatterplot gdpPercap vs pop by each continent 

Before
```{r, fig.width= 12, fig.height=8}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(lifeExpLvl=(lifeExp-mean(lifeExp))/mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_point(alpha  = .6, aes(color = lifeExpLvl)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, scales = "free") + 
  ggtitle("Scatterplot gdpPercap vs pop by each continent")
```

After

```{r, fig.width= 12, fig.height=8}
forGGSave<- 
  gapminder %>%
  mutate(lifeExpLvl=(lifeExp-mean(lifeExp))/mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_point(alpha  = .6, aes(color = lifeExpLvl)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, scales = "free") + 
  ggtitle("Scatterplot gdpPercap vs pop by each continent") +
  scale_colour_distiller(palette="Spectral")
forGGSave
```

## Problem 5: Writing figures to file

```{r}
ggsave(paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "ggSave.png", sep = ""), width = 12, height = 8, plot = forGGSave)
```

Below figure is retrieved from the code `![plot](ggSave.png)`. 
![plot](paste(getwd(), "/HW5_files/", "ggSave.png", sep = "")

## Problem 6: But I want to do more
```{r}
favFood <- data.frame(
  country = c("Germany", "Japan", "Korea, Rep.", 
              "China", "United States", "France"),
  food = c("Beer", "Sushi", "BBQ", 
           "Hotpot", "Burger", "Steak"),
  stringsAsFactors=TRUE)

slope_small <-
  gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Germany", "Japan", "Korea, Rep.", 
                        "China", "United States", "France"), 
         year %in% c(2002,2007)) %>%
  droplevels()%>%
  left_join(., favFood, by = "country") %>%
  arrange(lifeExp)

levels(slope_small$country)
levels(slope_small$food) 
```

It can been seen that both factor `country` and `food` are arranged alphabetically, and not matching each other. Let's firstly extract the unique matching and then reorder them and let them match with each order. 

```{r  results = 'asis'}
uniq_ss <- slope_small %>%
  dplyr::select(country, food) %>%
  unique()

slope_small$food <- 
  slope_small$food %>% fct_relevel(as.character(uniq_ss$food))

slope_small$country <- 
  slope_small$country %>% fct_relevel(as.character(uniq_ss$country)) 
```

Now they are mapping to each other.

```{r}
str(slope_small)
```


## Report your process

This homework in general is a little hard compared to the others because my experience in manipulating with factors is limited. Meanwhile, I challenged myself in Taks 1.3 when reordering the `country` based on its average gdp increase rate across all years available. My first thought is to build up a function and then use apply. My function of recording the increase per year is as follows: 

```{r  eval=FALSE}
gdpIncrease <- function(countryDat) {
  year.min <- min(countryDat[,"year"])
  year.max <- max(countryDat[,"year"])
  year.count <- n_distinct(countryDat[,"year"])
  cntryUseful <- 
    countryDat %>%
    filter(year %in% c(year.min, year.max)) %>%
    mutate(
      totalGDP = gdpPercap * pop,
      lagtotalGPD = lag(totalGDP),
      incRate = (totalGDP - lagtotalGPD) / (year.max - year.min)
    ) %>%
    na.omit()
  return(mean(cntryUseful[1,"incRate"]))
}
```

However, when I use the function `apply()`, there is a problem
```{r  eval=FALSE}
a<- as.matrix(gapminder[c(1:12),-c(1:2)])
apply(a,  MARGIN=c(4, 12), FUN = function(x) gdpIncrease(x))
```
I spent almost two days in figuring out why it is the case, but still achieve nothing. So I tackled the problem with another method: fitting the linear model as you see. But any help with this debugging will be appreciated!

Also, because I have loaded MASS library and dplyr library, when I was using select(), I got error message: `Error in select(., "year") : unused argument ("year")`. After searching stackoverflow, I finnally got that two libraries both have the function select(), so R was confusing when I didn't specify which library want for the select() function.
